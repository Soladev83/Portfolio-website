            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am an aspiring web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by learning the React framework. 
                My journey in software development has led me to explore multiple programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java, through which I have built several projects.
                <br><br>
                I am highly passionate about creating user-friendly and efficient web applications. My keen interest lies in front-end development, but I am also enthusiastic about full-stack development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. 
                As an open-minded and dedicated learner, I continuously explore new technologies and best practices in the industry to enhance my problem-solving skills.
                <br><br>
                I am currently interning at a software company, where I apply my skills to real-world projects, collaborate with experienced developers, and gain hands-on experience in building scalable web applications.
